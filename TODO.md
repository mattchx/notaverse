### Learning Support Features (Phase 3)
- [ ] Enhanced search functionality:
  - [ ] Search within specific courses/media
  - [ ] Filter by note types and tags
  - [ ] Save common searches
- [ ] Resource management:
  - [ ] Add resource links to notes
  - [ ] Resource categorization
  - [ ] Quick reference view
- [ ] Study aids:
  - [ ] Export notes by section/topic
  - [ ] Generate study summaries
  - [ ] Key points highlighting

## üéØ Future Improvements
- [ ] Knowledge organization:
  - [ ] Concept mapping
  - [ ] Topic relationships
  - [ ] Learning progress tracking
- [ ] Collaborative features:
  - [ ] Note sharing
  - [ ] Study groups
  - [ ] Discussion threads
- [ ] Advanced features:
  - [ ] AI-assisted organization
  - [ ] Spaced repetition support
  - [ ] Knowledge visualization
- [ ] Section hierarchy research:
  - [ ] Investigate nested sections for large courses
  - [ ] Consider UX implications and complexity
  - [ ] Research alternatives like:
    - Using tags for sub-grouping
    - Enhanced section naming conventions
    - Visual section grouping without database nesting
  - [ ] Evaluate based on actual user needs and usage patterns

## Development Guidelines
1. Focus on core note-taking improvements first
2. Build features incrementally
3. Test thoroughly with real course content
4. Gather user feedback early
5. Maintain simplicity in UI/UX

## Research Notes
- Nested sections: While useful for large courses, the added complexity might not justify the benefit at this stage. Current flat section structure with good organization tools (tags, search, filtering) may be sufficient. Revisit based on user feedback and actual usage patterns.
